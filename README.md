# 🐚 chaosshell

Hello fellas! 👋  
Welcome to my **chaosshell** is a minishell project — a simplified implementation of a Unix shell written in C.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is **not the final optimized version**.

## 📌 About
This project is part of my journey into learning systems programming and building custom shells. It handles basic shell functionality and aims to replicate some behaviors of real-world shells like `bash`.

  Thanks for checking it out! 🙂
